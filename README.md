#MORE DETAIL:

Inside this project,I create a class called GameField:

##properties:
`height`,                     //number of row.  <br>
`width`,                      //number of column. <br>
`win_value`,                  //How many score do you need to win? <br>
`score`,                      //current score.<br>
`high_socre`,                 //highest score you ever have. <br>
                                                            
`field`,                      // I create this in reset()   <br>
                              //according to your given height and width to make a field <br>
##method:
  reset(self)                 //called in __init__ 
                              //create field and also create two spawn 
  move(self,direction)
