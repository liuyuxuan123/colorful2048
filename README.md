#MORE DETAIL:

Inside this project,I create a class called GameField:

##properties:
*height,                     //number of row.  
*width,                      //number of column. 
*win_value,                  //How many score do you need to win? 
*score,                      //current score.
*high_socre,                 //highest score you ever have. 
                                                            
*field,                      // I create this in reset()   
                              //according to your given height and width to make a field 
##method:
  reset(self)                 //called in __init__ 
                              //create field and also create two spawn 
  move(self,direction)
